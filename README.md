## Summary

Sayonara is a travel blog and community in which users can create and manage their own blogs and engage with a wider community of like-minded travelers through liking and commenting on blogs.

This app was built using React and is the front-end/client for the back-end/server which was also built as part of this project, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Barrymoonshine/blog-API).

Hosted and deployed on Vercel.

## Features

- Create, view, edit and delete blog posts
- Like and comment on blogs
- Delete comments
- Manage account details, such as updating password and username
- Filter travel blogs by geographic region
- JWT authentication

## Key skills employed

- React app created using Vite for improved speed and performance over the now deprecated create react app
- Single Page Application (SPA) with all navigation completed client side with the React Router DOM package, including linking and navigating to new pages when tasks have completed
- Utilised the `useEffect` hook to get data from the server on page load, and when needed by a specific page/component
- Authentication via JWT stored in local storage and authenticated if user re-visits page
- Handling and displaying errors generated by the back and front-end
- Installed the React Hook Form package to remove the normal boilerplate associated with managing forms in 'vanilla' React
- Combination of global state management where state is needed across multiple levels of the app and local state management where state is only used in that component
- Prop type checking using the Prop Types package to help detect issues with passing incorrect data types
